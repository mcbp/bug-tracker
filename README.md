# Bug Tracker

A bug management application featuring issue capturing and tracking, multiple project support, JWT based authentication, and user role management.

This project was built with a Node.js and Express backend to provide a REST API that manages user accounts, projects and bug tickets from a MongoDB database.
The frontend was developed using React with a large focus on Redux to manage global state.
